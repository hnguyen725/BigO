# BigO
Big-O is an Android application that allows users to get access to a reference of run-time complexity about common data structures and sort algorithms. What’s more, the application also allows users to run speed tests to compare the run-time between these data structures and sort algorithms. With the help of the MPAndroidChart library, the application allows users to see these test results as a visual bar-chart representation.
